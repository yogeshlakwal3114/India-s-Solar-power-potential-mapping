# How to access Dataset
Adding Dataset to your Google Drive
1. Go to this folder which contains the data to process. <a href='https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dH_s4wOHVpXGHiNCDzUWu-sfk8wQU_RH?usp=sharing'>Google Drive<a/>
2. Download that folder to your system.
3. Open your Google Drive and upload this folder there.
4. Make sure to change the links used in the code cells below depending on how you want to use it.
5. Resultant image from any step will by default save below the sample_data folder of your drive (see it in the left side of your page). So, here we have set the same path for calling them in the code which do not need to change.
6. But remember, here data are stored temporarily which can be lost if the page get refreshed.
7. To prevent loosing the output data, click on the particular output and drag it to your drive folder for permanent saving it and then change its path in the code for calling it.
